The sound of a buzzer is determined by several factors:

1. Frequency:
The primary factor influencing the sound is the frequency of the electrical signal sent to the buzzer. Higher frequencies will create higher-pitched tones, while lower frequencies will create lower-pitched tones. The code uses the tone() function to modulate the frequency based on the joystick position, allowing you to control the pitch of the sound.

2. Waveform:
The shape of the electrical waveform can also affect the sound quality. Most buzzers use a square wave waveform, which produces a basic buzzing sound. Some buzzers may support other waveforms like triangles or sawtooths, which can generate different sound characteristics.

3. Physical characteristics:
The physical properties of the buzzer itself also play a role. The size and material of the diaphragm, the coil, and the case all contribute to the overall sound quality. For example, a larger diaphragm will tend to produce louder sounds, while a smaller diaphragm may produce sharper tones.

4. Circuitry:
The circuitry driving the buzzer can also influence the sound. Some circuits may include additional components like capacitors or resistors that can adjust the sound volume or filter out unwanted noise.
In this case, the specific sound your buzzer makes is a combination of all these factors. The dominant factor, however, is likely the frequency generated by the code and sent to the buzzer through the tone() function. By varying the frequency based on the joystick movement, you can create different pitches and explore various sound effects.

For further exploration, you can experiment with different frequencies, try different waveforms if your buzzer supports them, and investigate additional electronic components in the circuit to fine-tune the sound characteristics to your liking.
